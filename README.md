# Polycrystalline-Silicon-MOSFET-Based Capacitorless DRAM With Grain Boundaries and Its Performances

ABSTRACT In this work, a capacitorless one-transistor dynamic random access memory (1T-DRAM) based
on a polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) metal_oxide_semiconductor _eld-effect transistor was designed and
analyzed through a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation. A poly-Si thin _lm was utilized
within the device because of several advantages, including its low fabrication cost and the feasibility of its
use in high-density three-dimensional (3D) memory arrays. An asymmetric dual-gate structure is proposed
to perform the write ``1'' operation and achieve high retention characteristics. The proposed 1T-DRAM cell
demonstrates a high sensing margin of 8.73 _A/_m and a high retention time of 704.4 ms compared to
previously reported 1T-DRAMs, even at a high temperature. In addition, the effect of grain boundaries on
the memory performance of the proposed device was investigated, and the results validated the excellent
reliability of its retention characteristics even in the presence of grain boundaries (>64 ms at T D 358 K).

# I. INTRODUCTION
Capacitorless one-transistor dynamic random-access memory (1T-DRAM) has attracted a great deal of attention as a substitute for conventional one-transistor one-capacitor (1T-1C) DRAM. Given the difficulty of capacitor fabrication, the researchers have proposed the 1T-DRAM, which eliminate the need for capacitor altogether as a substitute for the conventional DRAM. The 1T-DRAM does not use an external capacitor, and instead relies on the principle of floating body effect. 1T-DRAMs have the advantage of simple fabrication and excellent compatibility with logic devices [1]-[11]. However, the smaller dimensions of these devices tend to limit their retention characteristics because of the stronger electric field between the body and the source/drain junctions. The stronger electric field increases the recombination/generation rate of excess holes, and the down-scaled 1T-DRAMs have the short retention time [12]. Therefore, 3D memory arrays can be a solution to increase the retention time of 1T-DRAMs. 1T-DRAMs based on polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) have attracted attention due to the feasibility of obtaining high- density 3D memory arrays. Poly-Si-based transistors have previously been employed in 3D memory technology because of their significant advantages related to integrated fabrication technology [13]-[15].

In this work, a poly-Si metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) based 1T-DRAM cell with
an asymmetric dual-gate structure, to realize superior memory performance, was investigated through a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation. The memory performance characteristics of the proposed 1T-DRAM cell, namely, its sensing margin and retention time, were obtained and analyzed based on parameters calibrated against the experimental data in [13] to ensure high accuracy. Moreover, the effect of grain boundaries (GBs) within the poly-Si layers on the reliability of the device was investigated.
